# LeetCodeSolution
This repository contains all the solution of Leet Code which is generally practice by Students . The implementation is in Python.
1. Problem 1 - https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/
   
    Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

    Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these   two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 < numbers.length.
    Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
  
    The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice. Your solution must use only constant extra space.

2. Problem 2 - https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/
 
    Linked List Cycle

    Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

    There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by       continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that    tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

    Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

 3. Problem 3 - https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/
    
    Palindrome Linked List

    Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

4. Problem 4 - https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list
    
    Remove Nth Node From End of List

    Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

5. Problem 5 - https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii/
    
    Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

    Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

7. Problem 7 - https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/
    
    Set Matrix Zeroes

    Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's. You must do it in place.

7. Problem 8 - https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/
    
    Validate Binary Search Tree

    Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

    A valid BST is defined as follows:

       a. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
       b. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
       c. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
